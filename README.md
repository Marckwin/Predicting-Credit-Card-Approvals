# Credit-Card-Approval
A machine learning model that predicts if a credit card application will get approved.
# Overview
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this notebook, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.
# Tasks
  * Preparing dataset
  * Pairwise relationships between continuous variables
  * Normalizing the feature data
  * Principal Component Analysis on the scaled data
  * Further visualization of PCA
  * Train a decision tree to classify genre
  * Compare the decision tree to a logistic regression
  * Balance the data for greater performance
  * Does balancing the dataset improve model bias?
  * Using cross-validation to evaluate our models
